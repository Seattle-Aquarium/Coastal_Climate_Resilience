# Seattle_Aquarium_Coastal_Climate_Resilience
This is a public repository to organize information and documents pertaining to the Seattle Aquarium's Coastal Climate Resilience (CCR) program. 
Specifically, our work involves the customization, testing, and deployment of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), dubbed ROV *Nereo* & and ROV *Lutris* to conduct video/photo surveys of the underlying seafloor and benthic community structure. 
We have developed and tested standardized protocols to use small, relatively inexpensive, and readily deployable ROVs to conduct standardized surveys along relatively shallow coastal areas (5-40m depth), especially along canopy-forming and understory kelp forest locations. 
We envision fully integrating ROVs as another tool in the coastal ecologists' toolkit that can (among other missions) complement and enhance existing long-term subtidal monitoring programs. 

Our objectives include: 
* **1.** Expand the spatial extent across which we gather high-resolution photo/video data across the seafloor. 
* **2.** Use open-source AI methods of image analysis to efficiently extract large amounts of data from our ROV-derived imagery. 
* **3.** Integrate these ROV-derived data with other sources of information such as data from scuba divers, fixed sensors, autonomous surface vessels (ASVs), drones, and satellite imagery, all to maximize our inferences about benthic community structure, stability, and resilience.
* **4.** We commit to pursue **1.** - **3.** in an open-source, open-access manner such that our partners, collaborators, and the public can copy what we've started in order to advance their own coastal monitoring, conservation, restoration, and management objectives. We likewise commit to actively support our partners in the development of their own ROV programs. Similar to the broad geographic reach of the standardized protocols set down by scientific diver programs such as Reef Check and PISCO, we envision a network of partners using standardized ROV survey protocols to enhance our collective data collection, analysis, and coordination capacity.

The purpose of this repo is to make general and introductory information about the CCR program as accessible as possible to our partners, collaborators, and the public. 
All information and documentation assocaited with the repo is freely available to download and share. 
We welcome collaborators and partners, as well as feedback, comments, and questions. Please direct contact to z.randell@seattleaquarium.org
