# Seattle_Aquarium_ROV_development
This is a public repository to organize information and documents pertaining to the customization, testing, and deployment of the Seattle Aquarium's BlueROV2, dubbed ROV *Nereo*. As part of the Coastal Complexity & Resilience project run by Conservation Programs & Partnerships (CPP), we have develped and tested standardized protocols to use a small, relatively inexpensive, and readily deployable ROV to conduct photo/video surveys along relatively shallow seafloor (5-30m depth), especially along canopy-forming and understory kelp forest locations. Our mission is to expand the spatial extent across which we gather data and make inferences about benthic community structure, stability, and resilience. We are not seeking to replace scientific SCUBA diving-based monitoring, but rather we envision using ROVs as an additional tool alongside divers that will complement and enhance existing long-term subtidal monitoring programs. The purpose of this repository is to make information as accessible as possible to our partners, collaborators, and the public. 

If you desire to "get into the weeds" in terms of code, analyses, and the management of the various sensor/data streams from the ROV, see our other public repository [Seattle_Aquarium_ROV_telemetry_imagery_analysis](https://github.com/zhrandell/Seattle_Aquarium_ROV_telemetry_imagery_analysis)
