# Seattle_Aquarium_ROV_development
This is a public repository to organize information and documents pertaining to the development and testing of the Seattle Aquarium's BlueROV2, _WaksaÂ·s_, a Makah word for octopus.

Our objective is to develop methods of using a small, relatively inexpensive, and readily deployable ROV to conduct photo/video surveys along shallow (5-40m) regions of the seafloor, including along urchin-barrens and locations characterized by understory/turf algae and canopy kelp forests. The latter environment in particular will undoutebly pose challenges, but even a partial success surveying kelp forests could radically expand the spatial extent across which we gather data and make inferences. We are not seeking to replace scientific SCUBA diving-based monitoring, but rather envision using ROVs as an additional tool operating alongside divers.
